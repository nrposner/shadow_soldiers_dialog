Not bourgeois romantic love, or feudal familial love, or reactionary love of country, but the superior and pure love of the worker standing by your side. The CIA's modus operandi is to undermine the foundation of communism by turning comrades against one another. This objective, to our great misfortune, has been largely successful. Everywhere now, you can see signs of bourgeois romantic love displacing true communist camaraderie, and bringing with it a perverse focus on sex. But this train of thought, by re-associating the apparently sexual elements with the suffering of one's comrades, reinforces the revolutionary spirit and wards off capitalist infiltration. The only reason you recoil from this image, instead of embracing it, is because you yet possess a remnant of the bourgeois ego, nurtured by CIA propaganda, to which laying down all and destroying all boundaries for the sake of your comrades is unacceptable.
